# Blackjack is a classic casino game of luck and strategy

# Face cards each count as 10, Aces count as 1 or 11, all others count at face value. An Ace with any 10, Jack, Queen, or King is a “Blackjack.” 
# If you have a Blackjack, the dealer pays you one-and-a-half times your bet — unless the dealer also has a Blackjack, in which case it's a “push” and neither wins.
